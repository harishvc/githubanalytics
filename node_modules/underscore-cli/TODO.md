# General
* implement more commands
* aliases
* compile expressions inside expressions - map(data, value+1);  or should i just use coffee?

# Nits and Nuance
* for 'process' if 'data' is mutated, that should be considered the return value.  Thus "data.version++" works, and "fn_of(data)" works as well
* unify 'run' + 'process' - if 'data' is not referenced, then don't bother reading input.
* pluck should support the dot notation "field1.field2"



Add Some Serious Fancy
* add the 'summarize' command.  With the new Formatter class, we are 1/2way there
* add the 'compile' magikness - flow a magic value through a bash pipe chain and emit a full JS script out the other side that does what the one-liner did


# Docs
 * Implement 'underscore help strict' and 'underscore help json' that display detailed info on data input / output
 * compatibility grid for data formats

# Test
 * convert test.sh to pure-JS under Mocha 
 * add tests for file input / output, and various formats


# Data Formats
 * npm module (filename only) - can this be autodetected?
 * recursive directory of JSON
 * XML
 




# Done:
 * Fancy - custom formatter that does smart-whitespace
 * Nuance - autodetect CoffeeScript
 * Docs - examples for data formats
 * Nuance - eliminate --nowrap.
 * Nuance - proper line numbers in template errors
 * Docs - Examples.md (autogenerated)
 * Docs - colorize help - with WHITE for bolding
 * Docs - autogenerate README.md from a template and the command-line help output
